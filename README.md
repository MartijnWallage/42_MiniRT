## Components

MiniRT, a joint project of the <a href="https://42berlin.de/curriculum-42-berlin/">42 Core Curriculum</a>, is a ray tracer written in C. 
We get to choose between two openGL graphics libraries, one bad and one good.
After some deliberation, we chose the <a href="https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42">good one</a>.

## Parsing

The input to miniRT is a .rt file which describes a scene.

A scene consists of a camera, a spotlight (or several, for the bonus version), and various geometrical objects: planes, spheres and cylinders. 
Each of these things have a position, a direction, a color, and, for the bonus, some information on how much ambient, diffuse and specular light it emits or reflects.

In addition, we need a viewport, a rectangular plane which by convention is at a distance of 1 from the camera. Its height and width make up the resolution of the picture that we want to produce.

We parse this into a struct, which mainly consists of vectors, colours (stored as ints, though perhaps vectors would have been better), and some additional information.

## Raytracing

The idea of ray tracing is that, for each pixel in the image, you shoot a ray from the camera through the corresponding point in the viewport into the scene.
You then calculate the nearest point (if any) where the ray intersects with an object in the scene.

That is already enough information to make a basic picture: for each ray that intersects with an object, its colour (the colour of the corresponding pixel) will be the colour of the object mixed with the colour of the ambient lighting. The rays that don't intersect with any object return black.

We then shoot another ray from the spotlight (or several rays from the several spotlights) to that point on the surface of the object, and calculate how the light affects the colour of the object.

For the bonus version, this second calculation comprises both diffuse and specular lighting. We also implemented anti-aliasing and, because anti-aliasing slowed the whole thing down so much, multi-threading.
